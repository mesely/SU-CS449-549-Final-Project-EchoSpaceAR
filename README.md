## 🧠 Project Overview
EchoSpace-AR is an augmented reality system designed to enhance environmental awareness for users who cannot rely on sound.  
It captures real-world audio, classifies and interprets it using machine learning models, and presents **spatial, visual cues** in AR to reduce ambiguity and cognitive load.

---

## 🧩 HCI Foundations
The project is grounded in Human-Computer Interaction principles:

- **Norman’s Stages of Action**  
  Supporting goal formation, execution, and evaluation through immediate visual feedback.

- **Information Foraging Theory**  
  Reducing information scent cost by presenting only the most relevant environmental cues in the HUD.

---

## 🏛️ HCI Alignment (Four Pillars)
- **User Interface Requirements**  
  XR HUD readability, font scaling, spatial placement, attention cues.

- **Guidelines Documents & Process**  
  Meta XR & Unity XR best practices, iteration checklist (latency, comfort, UX).

- **User Interface Software Tools**  
  Unity XR Toolkit, Meta XR SDK, YAMNet sound classification, Whisper speech-to-text, backend integration.

- **Expert Reviews & Usability Testing**  
  On-device testing (Quest 2 / Quest 3), expert evaluations, Python-based audio analysis pipeline.

## 🧪 Usability Testing & Data Logging
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**
- **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**
- Logged metrics:
  - User reaction time
  - Classification accuracy
  - System response latency

---

## ⚖️ Design Trade-offs
- Visibility vs. visual clutter  
- Urgency signaling vs. distraction  
- Precision vs. simplicity  

**Limitations**
- Lower accuracy in complex acoustic environments  
- AR field-of-view constraints  
- Short learning curve required
